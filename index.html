        <h1>My Game Development Dream: From Player to Creator</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my Coursera final project website.</p>
        <p>This is not only the test for week 1 but also a place where I share my dream of becoming an indie game developer.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>In the past, I really enjoyed playing games. Whenever I immersed myself in the virtual world, I felt the joy and excitement that those games brought. </p>
        <p>It was those emotions that motivated me: I also wanted to create similar joy for others. I believe that creating a game can provide entertaining experiences and valuable connections.</p>

        <h2>Dreams and Study Plans</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Main goal: </strong>After this HTML course, I will take a Unity course on Coursera.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>To gain experience in order to build my own game project.</li>
            <li><strong>Why I chose Coursera: </strong>I have taken several Coursera courses before and found them very helpful. I believe that the game development course will greatly assist me in creating games and nurturing my passion for IT.</li>
            <li><strong>Game idea: </strong>Although I do not have a specific idea for my first game yet, I believe that the experience I gain will help me come up with a unique concept.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Curious about the Gaming Industry.</h2>
        <p>My interest goes beyond just game programming. I also want to learn more about how major game companies operate.</p>
        <p>I want to know about other jobs such as sound design, event organization in games, and creating visual effects. This is a vast field that I want to explore comprehensively.</p>
